# QR_code_generator
QR Code Generator is a simple desktop application built using Python, Tkinter, and the qrcode library.

This project was created as an attempt to learn Python programming, explore GUI development, and understand how to integrate external libraries into a functional tool.

The application allows users to:

Enter any text or link

Specify a custom filename for the QR code image

Choose the size and detail level of the QR code

Instantly generate and preview the QR code

The goal of this project wasn’t to reinvent the wheel, but to:

Get hands-on experience with Python basics and GUI design

Learn how to turn a small idea into a working desktop app

Understand how external Python packages can be used to add real functionality

This is a beginner-friendly project — small in scope, but useful, practical, and a solid step in learning how to build and share Python applications.
